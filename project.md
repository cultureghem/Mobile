Cultureghem is an association that looking for solutions to share the open space under the Anderlecht Slaughterhouse, which is an urban laboratory in which we test, develop and experiment. In this way, we bring solutions to people, that they can reuse where they need it.

From 2013, we start to develop mobile kitchens. And you can find here the very first model, DRISS.

Mobile kitchens are tools that invite people to cook or share a meal. Designed open, welcoming, accessible, light, independent, and mobile, to move easily from one place to another.
